		This is an ongoing robotics research project for which I was awarded a grant from the science and technology center of the swiss military <i>armasuisse S+T</i> over 50'000CHF (52'000€) in early 2024. Many thanks to prof. Christian Bermes from the University of Applied Sciences of the Grison <i>FHGR</i> for enabling my proposal. Results of this project will be presented at the "Advanced Robotic Capabilities for Hazardous Environments" ARCHE in the summer of 2024. In this timespan I'll be the project manager and sole contributor to the project. Until I'm ready to publish some more details, you can read the abstract of the grant proposal here below.

	<h2>Abstract of Grant Proposal</h2>
	<p>
		Aerial robotics is an already well established, but still quickly growing field in research. Between the multitude of problems that can be solved with a flying drone are tasks of exploration and inspection in areas unsafe or inaccessible to humans. When these areas lie indoors or in otherwise tightly enclosed environments, it can become necessary for a drone to traverse small gaps. Gap traversal is not in and of itself an overly difficult problem, but it does bring with it a design trade-off. The drone needs to be small enough to fit trough the gap, but at the same time it is well known that drones with large propellers are more efficient and thus offer longer flight times.
	</p>
	<p>
		The aim of this project is to sidestep the gap size vs. flight time trade-off by exploring a novel morphing drone design. A design where the drone can, temporarily and on command, morph into a smaller and less efficient shape to easily traverse a gap. Although, morphing drone designs do not typically come for free. If additional actuators for morphing are needed, then the trade-off is simply shifted to an increase in complexity/weight. To truly sidestep the gap size vs. flight time trade-off, the here proposed morphing design does not feature any additional actuators and only a very limited increase in complexity. Still, the design is expected to reach ~50% in width reduction in exchange for some temporary efficiency loss. An accomplishment that hasn’t been reached before.
