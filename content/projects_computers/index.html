	<h1>Portable Computers (2013-2020)</h1>

	<h2>Pi-Box (2013)</h2>
	<p>
		My first adventure into electronics started when my old friend Boba from the UK gifted me a first-generation Raspberry Pi. It was terribly slow even at the time, but that didn't mater. I really wanted to put it in a box, make it portable, and bring it with me wherever I wanted. So I got my hands on a backup camera monitor from eBay, some DC converters, a LiPo battery for RC airplanes, various USB accessories, and started tinkering. Miraculously I managed to not miswire anything and the box ended up working for years to come. It had a big public appearance when it displayed a video of my simulated landslide at the matriculation project exposition at ETH Zürich in 2013.

	<h2>Surface Shield (2014)</h2>
	<p>
		When I started studying in university my parents bought me a first-generation Microsoft Surface tablet. It was a great device, especially for note taking, but it had a few issues. Namely, a small battery, few USB slots, little memory, no SIM card, no HDMI port, and the back was getting uncomfortably hot. Naturally I wanted to solve all these issues. So I did, by strapping this monstrosity to the back of the laptop.

	<h2>Desk-Pack v1 (2017)</h2>
	<p>
		Next up was a bigger project. I didn't like having to compromise between a powerful desktop computer at home and a slow laptop computer at university. So I tried to pack my desktop computer in a laptop bag. To make everything fit (and because it looked cool) I watercooled the entire thing (CPU+GPU). I still remember getting all the hardline tubings bent such that they would fit being a huge pain. This portable computer served me very well, until the day I stupidly assumed I was measuring low voltages with a USB oscilloscope, when in fact I was measuring mains voltage. This promptly fired the oscilloscope, taking the whole computer down with it.

	<h2>Desk-Pack v2 (2019)</h2>
	<p>
		The successor of Desk-Pack v1 couldn't just match it again, it had to improve on it. At this point I had a small CNC router and a 3D printer in my own little workshop that I could put to good use. The plan was to mill the water channels into a large chuck of acrylic to easily reach all heat producing components and then have everything mounted on top of a huge copper radiator. It turned out to be a quite tricky task to get all the tolerances correct such that there would be good contact and no leaks, but I did manage. Also challenging was that I wanted to make my own fan controller and temperature sensor. I did so by designing and milling out a PCB from copper clad board on the CNC router. Sadly this computer also wasn't long for this world. It used to rest on top of a wall mounted shelf, and due to its heavy weight, in the middle of the night, the entire shelf came crashing down. All components survived, but from that point on various leaks started appearing.

	<h2>Desk-Pack v3 (2020)</h2>
	<p>
		Not being in the mood anymore for experiments with watercooled portable computers, I recycled most components of the V2, put air-coolers on them and crammed them into an utilitarian pelican case. This is the computer that I use at home up to this day (2023). And I have to admit, that the portable aspect of the case didn't find much use. So for the next computer I’ll probably revert back to an ordinary desktop case. Nevertheless, this portable computer adventure has been a very interesting journey.
