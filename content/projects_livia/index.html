	<h1>Livia Ornithopter (2024)</h1>
	<p>
		In 2023 I worked for 9 months as a PhD candidate at the Biomimetics Lab in Groningen, Netherlands. I saw myself forced to resign due to insurmountable disagreements of both professional and personal nature with my supervisor, David Lentink. I wasn't the first one and probably won't be the last one either. What is left of that time are lots of notes and observations on how birds work, as well as many ideas on how to build robotic birds, called ornithopters. Since I claim these ideas as completely my own, and I won't let myself be be intimidated to drop them, I've decided to continue working on them as a hobby project. All results shown below were achieved after I left.

	<h2>Tail Mechanism</h2>

	<p>
		It is thought that the tail of a bird contributes significantly to its manoeuvrability and efficiency in flight. Four degrees of freedom are identified that achieve these characteristics: spread, yaw, pitch and roll of the tail. While there exist robotic bird tails that can perform all these motions, they are implemented as bulky series linkages with many moving parts.

		My realization was that a robotic tail can be built with four parallel actuators if they attach to four corners of a flexible tail that pivots around a fixed center. This arrangement is somewhat similar to how muscles act on the tail of a real bird! To build such a mechanism it was important to find good building materials. A good choice turned out to be the actual tail feathers of a real rock pigeon (Columba <i>livia</i>), a sheet of 0.2mm spring steel to connect them, hot glue to bind them, and RC helicopter linkages to drive the whole thing. But that isn't enough. To get the mechanism to work, careful consideration must be taken in choosing the location of every linkage and in calculating the width profile of the spring steel. Once this is done however, the result is an extremely compact and robust assembly, fit to be tested and then integrated into a robotic bird.
