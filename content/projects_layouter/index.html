		Originally the plan for my master's thesis was to finish development of my coaxial helicopter design (see project). Shortly before the start my supervisors Christian Lanegger and Marco Tognon from the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) at ETH ZÃ¼rich convinced me to take a different project instead: To build an aerial layouting tool prototype for HILTI. HILTI is a construction equipment company interested in a robotic worker that can autonomously draw layouting lines on the ceiling of construction sites. ASL had developed an omnidirectional drone particularly versed in coming into contact with its environment, so my task was to build a tool on top of that drone to precisely draw on a ceiling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the drone on its own was not accurate enough I had to get creative. My tool featured a Steward platform to add compliance and passive stability at the contact. Omniwheels to be able to push against the ceiling. A camera tracking system to track the relative position of the marker. And a retractable marker to actually do the drawing. The design process included a lot of simulations, optimization and validation, resulting finally in an average drawing error of 1.0mm (SD: 0.5mm), compared to 14.5mm (SD: 7.9mm) of the drone on its own.
	</p>
	<p>
		After I was done with the project (and somewhat burnt out), my supervisor Christian did a few more testflights and compiled all results in a paper presented at <i>Robotics: Science and Systems</i> 2022 in New York. Furthermore, HILTI was granted a PCT patent for the design.
