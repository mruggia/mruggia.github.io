	<h1>Marco's Omnidirectional MAV, MOMAV (2022)</h1>
	<img src="momav.jpg">
	<p>
		MOMAV is my own version of an omnidirectional drone, meaning one that can independently translate and rotate. I see it as an evolution of the omnidirectional drones built by the Autonomous Systems Lab, with whom I did my master thesis. This project is still ongoing, so I don't have too much to say, but here below is a video of one of its first flights (after a bit of PID tuning) filmed at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons. In the video the attitude is controlled to be fixed, and I control the translation with a RC transmitter.
