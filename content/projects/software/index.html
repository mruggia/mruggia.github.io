	<h2>KeyBot (2008)</h2>
	<img src="keybot.png">
	<p>
		In some video games it can be beneficial to constantly mash a certain button. That's not fun. KeyBot is an application to automate that task, with up to 3 "mashers" and user selectable hotkeys and speeds. This program employs a lot of very questionable coding practices, since it is one of my first efforts in coding, but it still appears to be functional.

	<h2>Biology Quiz (2009)</h2>
	<img src="bio_quiz.png">
	<p>
		In the second year of high school my biology teacher wanted the class to learn the Latin names of some 40 common plants and how to recognize them. That seemed like a quite boring task, so instead I spent a lot of time programming an app to quiz me. It works by presenting a random image of a plant on screen, asking the user for its species/family, and correcting the answer if necessary. The database of names and images is managed with a separate program. By the time I was done programming, my twin sister Alessandra who also went to class with me, was already long done memorizing.. But that's the way things go when automating tasks.

	<h2>DRS3 Player (2012)</h2>
	<img src="drs3.png">
	<p>
		At a time where the Swiss radio station SRF3 was still called DRS3 and there were only very rudimentary players, I decided to make my own. This application can play live radio and fetch metadata from a m3u stream, from which it can then find the appropriate cover art to display. Also implemented are tabs to listen to past DRS3 podcasts and to the hit-parade. While the UI still looks somewhat modern, it is the classical Windows Media Player waveform that gives away the year this was made in.

	<h2>SoundSwitcher (2015)</h2>
	<img src="soundswitcher.png">
	<p>
		Have you ever had the desire to quickly change the audio output from headphones to speakers in Windows 7? I have, and there were no solutions that satisfied me at the time. This simple program is the consequence that saved me a good few minutes of repeatedly digging trough menus over the years.

	<h2>BF4 Lamp Solver (2016)</h2>
	<img src="bf4_lamps.png">
	<p>
		In <i>Battlefield 4</i>, a first-person-shooter I used to play a lot, there is a puzzle with 20 lamps and 7 switches. Each switch flips the state of some of the lamps and the goal of the puzzle is to find the switch positions that result in all lamps being on. This program solvers the puzzle and offers a somewhat intuitive UI to input which switches affect each lamp and to see the effect of various switch positions. I ended up using this program only two times to get the games reward for me and my friend Nicolo (the reward being a skin for the player character).

	<h2>ETH Room Finder (2016)</h2>
	<img src="eth_roomfinder.png">
	<p>
		During my bachelor studies at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I had a lot of trouble finding quiet places to study and chat without being disturbed. Sometimes I would stumble upon unused classrooms that were just perfect, but often these were also full of people with the same idea. Luckily ETH offered a way to check occupancy of every room online, so all I had to do is write a program that goes trough each room and checks if it is unused at a given time, resulting in a short list of potential workplaces. This program has helped me a lot during my studies.
