	<h1>Video Games (2009-2016)</h1>

	<h2>Tiktaktoo (2009)</h2>
	<img src="tiktaktoo.png">
	<p>
		The oldest still surviving and (somewhat) working video game I ever programmed. It features the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with options for human vs. human or human vs. computer games. The computer always plays the optimal moves, which I managed by hardcoding every possible move, resulting in 3'555 lines of code.. Well, that's not completely true, as sometimes the computer also feels like playing two moves in a row for some reason ;) Surprisingly this game also manages to track win/lose/draw statistics.

	<h2>Schiffe versenken (2010)</h2>
	<img src="schiffe_versenken.png">
	<p>
		The second surviving video game I managed to dig up is a bit more ambitious and only slightly broken. <i>Schiffe versenken</i> is the German name for the game Battleship. In my version the player plays against a smart computer that is able to track down and sink damaged ships after searching for them at random. Since the play area is 20x20 instead of the common 10x10, the game ends up very drawn out. In fact, I'm not sure I ever played it all the way trough. Notable in this game is the inclusion of sound effects and music.

	<h2>Alberi (2012)</h2>
	<img src="alberi.png">
	<p>
		<i>Alberi</i> is a logic puzzle game designed by Giorgio Dendi, that I discovered on the Italian magazine <i>Brain Trainer</i>. Playing it on a paper magazine has the huge disadvantage that each game can only be played once, so I recreated it in software. This game includes 136 levels of various difficulties, copied from multiple magazines, and a fully functional level editor/creator. When writing this text I got tempted into booting the game back up, and promptly found myself playing it for a few hours. Use at your own risk.

	<h2>LoL MMORPG (2013)</h2>
	<img src="lol_mmorpg.png">
	<p>
		For many years I spent an inconsiderate amount of time playing video games like League of Legends (LoL) and various MMORPG's. At some point I thought, wouldn't it be cool if there was a LoL based MMORPG game? My own highly unofficial effort to make that game lasted about 6 months before I ran out of steam, realizing that coding an entire game-engine and game in C++/DirectX9 is quite a bit of work for one person (even if most 3D assets were "borrowed"). Still I'm proud of how far I came at that time and of the couple hundred YouTube views each one of my development update videos used to get.

	<h2>FSX Checklist (2016)</h2>
	<img src="fsx_checklist.png">
	<p>
		FSX Checklist is a piece of software for use with Flight Simulator X (FSX). It acts as a copilot reading out checklist items. The player (pilot) is supposed to execute the checklist action, say the appropriate response, and proceed to the next checklist item with the middle mouse-button. This feature is absent from stock FSX, but makes the gameplay much more immersive. Currently only the Boing 737 is supported, but the program is coded such that new checklists can be easily added and new copilot speech clips automatically generated (or at least this was the case before the website fromtexttospeech.com broke).
