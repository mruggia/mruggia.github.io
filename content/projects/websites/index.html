	<h2>Local Server (2011)</h2>
	<img src="localserver.png">
	<p>
		The very first website I made had a similar purpose to the one you're on right now. It documented my projects and hosted various files and programs. With time I recognized the need for increasingly flexible designs, so many more iterations followed. All of them were never publicly accessible, until this here latest version.

	<h2>Deltix (2011)</h2>
	<video autoplay muted loop style="margin-bottom:-40px;"><source src="deltix.webm" type="video/webm"></video>
	<p>
		My first real, albeit unpaid, job was an assignment to make an animation for the <i>deltix.ch</i> website. It works, as you can see, but my code never ended up being used online. This was my first and regrettably far from last experience using JavaScript.

	<h2>KTV (2012)</h2>
	<img src="ktv.png">
	<p>
		In high school I used to do fencing with our local club, the Kantonsschüler Turnverein Chur. For them I made the first website that actually went online. It was built completely from scratch with an original design and a pretty rudimentary logo.

	<h2>ZWG Rechner (2015)</h2>
	<img src="zwg.png">
	<p>
		2015 was an important year for my home canton of Graubünden, Switzerland. It was the last year before a law came into effect that heavily restricted secondary residences in touristy areas. Since my father worked at the office for spatial development at the time, I heard that many people had trouble understanding the wording of the law and its consequences. Indeed, it included some convoluted conditions on area usage. So I set out to program a website where one could input which building-areas they knew, which they didn’t, and which they wanted to maximize (for example by converting hotel rooms into rental apartments). All in all, the law used 6 variables, 3 equality conditions and 5 inequality conditions. I ended up hardcoding every case in JavaScript and putting it onto a website.

	<h2>Martino Ruggia (2015)</h2>
	<img src="martino_ruggia.png">
	<p>
		My uncle Martino is a luthier, and I made a website for him in 2015. It is one of the few that is still online and can be visited, although the server is very slow. A particularity of this website is that it implements an administrator page (PHP+MySQL), so that my uncle can change opening times or leave banner messages for clients all by himself. If you visit the website, consider starting the audio recording of Paganini’s Capriccio No. 24. The site should still remain navigable without interrupting the playback.

	<h2>MApp (2016)</h2>
	<img src="mapp.png">
	<p>
		In Switzerland one can find very high-quality free maps on <i>map.geo.admin.ch</i>. These are very useful when going hiking or biking. At the time it was not easily possible to download this map for offline use and my mobile data plan was certainty not good enough to view it online. The only logical consequence was that I had to write a script to download all of it (32GB) and a local website to display the result. When stored on an SD card on my smartphone it enabled me to always have a map at hand as long as my pone was charged.

	<h2>Homepage (2023)</h2>
	<img src="homepage.png">
	<p>
		After resigning my PhD position at the University of Groningen, I realized that I need to do a better job at marketing what I do. And what better way to do it than by dusting of my old web-development skills for a nice personal website? So here we are, on a website where I present myself and my projects.
