		In Switzerland every able-bodied male is obligated to do military service. Objectors of conscience can apply for civilian service instead, which lasts 1.5x as long as the military service. The later is what I chose. I did one half of my civilian service in a retirement home in Ilanz and the other half at the University of Lucerne. There I worked with the CC Thermal Energy Storage to maintain and operate a test-stand for the characterization of phase-change dispersions.

		Phase-change dispersions (PCD) are a combination of a liquid, like water, and a finely dispersed phase-change material (PCM), like paraffin wax. When heated up trough the melting point of the PCM, this mix exhibits an apparent increase in thermal capacity. It was on me to operate and make necessary modifications to the test-stand which measured this thermal capacity. The test-stand worked by cooling the PCD to a set temperature in a tank, running it trough a heater element of known power and recording the output temperature. I did a lot of these experiments for all kinds of PCD's produced by the lab. I also did data visualization and analysis. This was an interesting problem as it is not immediately obvious how one would get from multiple input/output temperature pairs to a thermal capacity curve.

		Regrettably I never took a picture of the test-stand itself and of how I rebuilt it.
