	<p>
		I always found the mechanism of helicopter rotorheads fascinating, so obviously at some point I tried to build some myself. I ended up making two designs and many iterations of each. One standard design and one coaxial design. The standard design I intended to mount on an RC plane to then do vertical takeoffs and landings, sort of like a V22 Osprey. While the coaxial design was interesting because it was simple and overactuated, with each rotor disk controlled independently. Although I'm still not sure of the usefulness of being able to control the rotor disks independently. None of the two designs ever flew. I started this project at a time where my little workshop was not equipped to do metalworking, so many of the components were 3D printed. I tried to mitigate risks by using carbon-fiber reinforced polymers in my FDM printer and special tough resins in my SLA printer, but it was not enough (as could be expected). During a test run of the standard design, where I tried to measure forces and torques with a custom-built force/torque sensor, the rotorhead violently exploded. That put an end to my experimentations. For now.
