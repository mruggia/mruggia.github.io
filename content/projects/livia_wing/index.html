	<h1>Livia Ornithopter Wing Kinematics (2025)</h1>
	<div class='page_date'>Created: 31.3.2025</div>
	<p>
		I'll let this project be introduced by the 1-page abstract that I prepared for the <i>Soft Aerial Robotics Workshop 2025</i>, which regrettably didn't take place. This is obviously still early-stage research, and a lot more is still to come. Since the Livia project is self-ideated, self-funded, and currently executed by only myself, I'm always on the lookout for funding/collaboration opportunities, from e.g. experimental biologists or aerodynamicists.
