	<p>
		Prof. Mirko Meboldt's people are much better at explaining what the <i>ETH Innovation Project</i> is about, so please watch their video down below. For me this project was one of the absolute highlights of my bachelor at ETH Zürich. I participated with a group of friends, Jöri, Cla, Rick and Christoph. We had a good time and even managed to do pretty well, reaching the 1<sup>st</sup> place in construction ranking and 4<sup>th</sup> place in competition ranking (out of 90 teams).

		Focus projects offer an opportunity to develop and build a product from A-Z during the 5<sup>th</sup> semester. I got taken into the <i>ftero</i> airborne wind energy project. <a href="https://projektneptun.ch/it/blog/read/ftero-new-ways-to-use-wind-power" style="display:inline;" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article that explains what it was about, so I don't have to (thanks Manu). I was responsible for the hover and transition controller, the sponsoring/wiki databases, and helped out building the prototype airplanes for controls testing whenever I could.
