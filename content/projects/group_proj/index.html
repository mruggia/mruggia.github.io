		I had my first contact with robotics playing with the <i>MECCANO Super Construction Set</i> as a kid. The first contact with non-educational hardware however was when I joined <a href="https://www.helveticrobot.ch/wettbewerbe/robotchallenge/robotchallenge-2011/" style="display:inline;" target="_blank">helveticrobot</a>, the robotics club of my highschool. With a group of 6 fellow students we participated in the RobotChallenge 2011, the European championship for self-made, autonomous, and mobile robots. We built a robot for the Puck Collect Challenge, that was supposed to collect pucks of its own color, while preventing an adversary from collecting theirs. I don't think a video of our effort exists anymore, but here below is a video of two of our competitors.

		Our robot didn't perform particularly well. Or more precisely, it worked well enough in our replica playing field at school, but once we went to the competition stage in Vienna, things went wrong. The stage was lit very strongly and made from very reflective material. This made it nearly impossible for our LED + photodiode to differentiate between puck colors. We tried a few hotfixes, but in the end couldn't make the detection work reliably. With the heavy penalty for picking up the wrong pucks, we weren't able to exit the group stage. Still, I remember the experience fondly.

	<h2>ETH Innovation Project (2015)</h2>

	<p>
		Prof. Mirko Meboldt's people are much better at explaining what the <i>ETH Innovation Project</i> is about, so please watch their video down below. For me this project was one of the absolute highlights of my bachelor at ETH Zürich. I participated with a group of friends, Jöri, Cla, Rick and Christoph. We had a good time and even managed to do pretty well, reaching the 1<sup>st</sup> place in construction ranking and 4<sup>th</sup> place in competition ranking (out of 90 teams).

	<h2>ftero (2017)</h2>

	<p>
		Focus projects offer an opportunity to develop and build a product from A-Z during the 5<sup>th</sup> semester. I got taken into the <i>ftero</i> airborne wind energy project. <a href="https://projektneptun.ch/it/blog/read/ftero-new-ways-to-use-wind-power" style="display:inline;" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article that explains what it was about, so I don't have to (thanks Manu). I was responsible for the hover and transition controller, the sponsoring/wiki databases, and helped out building the prototype airplanes for controls testing whenever I could.
