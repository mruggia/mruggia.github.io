	<h1>Quasi-Direct Drive Motor Tests (2022)</h1>
	
	<p>
		I and the Computational Robotics Lab (CRL) at ETH ZÃ¼rich strongly considered each other for a PhD position in design and optimization of legged robots, including building of real prototypes. The project didn't end up materializing, but	I still greatly value the people at that lab and the talks we had. Before splitting up I worked with them for 3 months as a research assistant, mainly on systems identification of quasi-direct drive actuators, as a sort-of preliminary test for the PhD project.

		Quasi-direct drive actuators are motors typically used in legged robots. They are equipped with a low reduction gearbox, which makes them strong but still backdriveable. This is important as it enables compliance and torque-control of the leg joints. What I wanted to find out was: How good is this torque-control actually? Turns out not very good, but still good enough for these robots to work surprisingly well. Below I've posted the plots of 5 of the tests. For the other 18 and for more details please download the report.
