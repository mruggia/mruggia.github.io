	<h1>FPV Flyers (2017-2024)</h1>

	<h2>FPV Drone (2017)</h2>

	<p>
		The first drone I flew was one cobbled together with AliExpress components by my friend Nicolo (not the one above). It didn't fly at all at first and we needed to replace basically every component before we learned how everything works. By the end we had a somewhat working first-person-view FPV drone, but flying at the limit is hard and so it kept crashing and breaking its arms. Aliexpress didn't have any more solid frames, but they did sell big 5mm thick carbon-fiber plates. So we designed and built our own indestructible drone (pictured above), by CNC milling that plate. And it really was indestructible. It lived up to 2022, when it was lost at sea near Groningen (NL) trough no fault of Ariane ;).

	<h2>FPV Plane (2019)</h2>

	<p>
		After working with fixed wing drones in the <i>ftero</i> student project, I wanted to have one to play around for myself. I bought a <i>Multiplex ParkMaster</i> airplane, the same one I modified for VTOL (vertical take-off & landing) at the student project. It offered great fun in flying (and in repairing). Until the day it crashed one to many times by smashing head-on into the light pole of a soccer field near Chur (CH) in 2021.

	<h2>Angela (2024)</h2>

		Angela is based on the <i>Heewing T1 Ranger</i> platform. The air inlets on its snout somewhat resemble the wrinkles around the mouth of former German chancellor Angela Merkel, thus the name. It features a <i>Matek F405-WTE</i> flight controller running <i>ArduPilot</i>. While it is capable of autonomous flight, most of the time I just fly it as a fun little FPV plane! My intention is to at some point use it as a test platform for my biomimetic tail. Its size and weight are fairly close to those of a carrion crow, for which feathers are easily available.
