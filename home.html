		<div class="intro">
			<p>
				I'm a robotics engineer and researcher currently working with the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons, Switzerland. Over the years I found myself focusing more and more on aerial robotics, although my passion lies in understanding and solving problems in general. Be that in mathematics, informatics, electronics, engineering, manufacturing, or any other field I have the need to understand. Like for example most recently bird anatomy.
			</p>
			<p>
				On this website I've collected many of my more notable projects, ranging from the very first computer scripts I wrote at 14, over a few adventures with numerical methods, up to my latest aerial robot designs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I find of myself that I greatly enjoy exchanging knowledge and having solution-oriented discussions with bright colleagues. But what I really can't do without is having the freedom to try and solve very difficult problems, even if the outcome is unsure.
